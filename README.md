# Overview

This is my implementation of the [Refactoring SQL for Modularity](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/take/refactoring-sql-for-modularity) dbt course using *dbt Core* and *duckdb*.

In addition, I added *docs* and *test* in order to use other features of dbt that were not discussed in the course.
